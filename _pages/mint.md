          <p>
           MINT participates in aggregation, digitization and technology-enabling projects & initiatives for digital cultural heritage [1]. These typically involve the design, implementation and execution of a metadata (and/or content) ingestion strategy, according to their respective domain(s) and scope, the participating institutions and, available resources and time. MINT services compose a web based platform that is employed from the first steps of such workflows, corresponding to the ingestion, mapping, transformation and enrichment of metadata records. According to the architecture, MINT implements a variety of remediation approaches for the resulting repository that allow for the storage, delivery, access and retrieval of metadata records. Deployment and integration also involve other systems and services, such as a portal and search engine, collection management and long term preservation systems, repositories etc. 
           </p>


          <p>
          Interoperability is achieved through the use of well defined metadata models, and the alignment of the providers' records to their requirements. MINT uses a visual mapping editor for the XSL language to implement crosswalks to the reference metadata model. It is being used by a growing number of providers that align proprietary data structures to a variety of standard or aggregation- specific models, and in that way establish and maintain interoperability with aggregators and Europeana.

          <h3>Key functionalities include:</h3>
          <ul>
  <li>Organization and user level access rights and role assignment.</li>
  <li>Collection and record management (XML serialisation).</li>
  <li>Direct import and validation according to registered schemas (XSD).</li>
  <li>OAI-PMH based harvesting and publishing.</li>
  <li>Visual mapping editor for the XSLT language.</li>
  <li>Transformation and previewing (XML and HTML).</li>
  <li>Repository deployment and remediation interfaces.</li>
</ul>
         <h3>MINT Technical Specifications </h3>
          <p>
            MINT handles metadata records from the content provider's delivery up to the aggregation repository(-ies), publication mechanism(s) and front-end(s). 
It is written in JAVA, JSP, HTML and Javascript. It uses PostgreSQL as an object-relational database with Hibernate as the data persistence framework, and mongoDB as a document-oriented database. MINT is also reusing other open source development frameworks and libraries according to specific deployments and customizations (e.g. see [5]). Mint source code versions (usually project-based) are released under a free software license (GNU Affero GPL). 
The platform offers a user and organization management system that allows the deployment and operation of different aggregation schemes with corresponding user roles and access rights. An authenticated Restful web service is currently being designed to interoperate with other user identity & authentication systems. 

          </p>
          <h3>Ingest </h3>
          <p>
            Registered users can upload their metadata records in XML or CSV serialization, using the HTTP, FTP and OAI-PMH protocols. Users can also directly upload and validate records in a range of supported metadata standards (XSD). XML records are stored and indexed for statistics, previews, access from the mapping tool and subsequent services. 
Current developments aim to support relational database schemata and OWL/RDFS ontologies as input. 

          </p>

            WITH was designed and developed in alignment with complementary services used and
            produced in the Europeana ecosystem, and informed by the design of respective
            infrastructures being developed such as Europeana Labs , the Europeana Cloud and
            LoCloud , and of more specialized applications targeting cultural heritage content
            visualization and re-use, such as the tools and pilots of AthenaPlus and EUscreen.
