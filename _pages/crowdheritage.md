            <p>
              Crowdheritage is an open platform developed with the contribution of the EC under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) program. The scope of the platform is to use the power of the crowd in order to improve the metadata quality of digital cultural heritage content stored in <a href="https://www.europeana.eu/en" target="_blank">Europeana</a>, the European portal for cultural heritage, and in the databases of cultural heritage institutions across Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
              The lack of granular and rich descriptive metadata highly affects the searchability and usability of the digital content stored in museums, libraries and archives and on Europeana, thus often frustrating the user experience on these institutions’ portals. In this context, crowdsourcing can offer a great opportunity for improving the metadata quality of digital cultural content in a scalable way, while at the same time engaging different user communities and raising awareness about cultural heritage assets.
            </p>
            <p>
              The platform will offer the possibility to cultural heritage institutions and aggregators to design and launch ad-hoc crowdsourcing campaigns for metadata quality improvement with gamification elements and verifiable results. Through these campaigns, users will be able to add annotations or validate existing ones in a user-friendly and engaging way.
            </p>
            <p>
              CrowdHeritage is an open-source platform that integrates and supports the Europeana APIs and several other available APIs from cultural institutions across the world, like the Rijksmuseum and the Digital Public Library of America). The Crowdheritage platform has been developed by the <a href="https://www.ails.ece.ntua.gr/" target="_blank">National Technical University of Athens</a> in collaboration with the <a href="https://fashionheritage.eu/" target="_blank">European Fashion Heritage Association</a>, the <a href="http://www.michael-culture.eu/" target="_blank">MICHAEL Culture Association</a>, the <a href="https://www.culture.gouv.fr/en/" target="_blank">Ministry of Culture of France</a> and the <a href="https://pro.europeana.eu/organisation/europeana-foundation" target="_blank">Europeana Foundation</a>.

            all around the world. Explore cultural treasures in extraordinary detail from

          <h3>API mashup</h3>
          <p>
            The platform mashups APIs from different digital CH resources, such as Europeana, the Digital Public Library of America, Rijksmuseum, the British Library, National Library of Australia, YouTube, Historypin etc, and provides a single powerful new service, which gives access to a huge set of heterogeneous items (images, videos, different metadata schemata etc). WITH supports a variety of different data models (e.g.,  EDM, LIDO etc) and formats (e.g. XML, JSON-LD), and resolves interoperability issues by performing automatic mappings in the backend.
          </p>
          <h3>Faceted search and navigation</h3>
          <p>
            WithCulture  offers federated and faceted search services, which enable the user to explore digital CH by applying multiple search criteria in different combinations. e.g., a user may wish to search for images from certain providers with specific rights etc. The user can navigate through the results via different presentation views and retrieve more information about items of interest.  .
          </p>
          <h3>Collection management</h3>
          <p>
          Via a personal workspace, users can aggregate and organise different types of cultural resources collected from external resources or uploaded by themselves and create their own collections and exhibitions using different presentation views. Users can annotate/tag cultural items and link them with external vocabularies and thesauri. The UI supports collaborative work and interactions between users so that they can create new stories together, share their creations with other users or user groups, like and comment other users’ collections, form teams etc.
