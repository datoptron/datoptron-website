            <h3>Data Transformation</h3>
            <p>Analysing information requires structured and accessible data for best results. Data transformation procedures enable organisations to adapt the representation and format of raw data and structure them depending on their needs. Datoptron sets in place well-defined and customisable procedures for mapping between different schemata. </p>

            <h3>Linked Data Integration</h3>
            <p>Leveraging many years of experience in machine learning and infromation extraction, Datoptron offers situation-appopriate solutions for making data uniform and interoperable. We use Natural Language Process, named entity extraction and pattern matching techniques to automatically link and enrich your data with trusted external web resources. We validate the results using a human-in-the-loop approach.</p>

            <h3>Linked Data Publication and Consumption</h3>
            <p>How can data be published as Linked Data? 
            <!--What kind of actions have to be taken in order to transform data according to Berners-Lee’s four principles? This points to transformation--> How can you unearth the knowledge underlying the data, identify hidden patterns, and discover what you are looking for? Datoptron's expertise in both relational and graph databases ensures that the right approach for storing and quering your data will be followed. From federated search and SPAQL endpoints to indexing strategies and search engine optimisation, we adopt the approach that best fits your application's queries.</p>

            <h3>Platform Development</h3>
            <p>Our platform development expertise makes sure that the capabilities enabled by the state-of-the-art data technologies are served to the end user  in a functional and appealing way. We build on well-defined Application Programming Interfaces  and deliver user-griendly interfaces using latest frontend frameworks and UX design best practices. We develop platforms for streanlinging organsational procedures as well as platforms for citizens' and customers' engagement.</p>

            <h3>Use of Standards and Vocabularies</h3>
            <p>We build on established taxonomies and situation-appropriate standards in all the above-mentioned steps.  We make use of well-founded schemata, controlled vocabularies, and ontologies to represent and manage data and metadata. We opt for open standards, wherever possible, and advocate  the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles.
            <!--We use taxonomies, thesauri, controlled vocabularies, and ontologies to manage your data. We use technologies such as SKOS, RDF, OWL, SACL, SCEX, and vocabularies such as DC, DCAT-AP, Core Vocabularies, EDM.-->
