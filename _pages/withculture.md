            <h1>WITHCulture</h1>
            <p>
WITHCulture is a platform that provides access to digital cultural heritage items from different repositories and  offers a number of added-value services for the creative reuse and intelligent exploitation of that content. It was designed and developed in alignment with complementary services used and
           produced in the Europeana ecosystem, and informed by the design of respective
           infrastructures being developed such as Europeana Labs, the Europeana Cloud and
           LoCloud, and of more specialized applications targeting cultural heritage content
           visualization and re-use, such as the tools and pilots of AthenaPlus and EUscreen.

          <h3>API mashup</h3>
          <p>
            The platform mashups APIs from different digital CH resources, such as Europeana, the Digital Public Library of America, Rijksmuseum, the British Library, National Library of Australia, YouTube, Historypin etc, and provides a single powerful new service, which gives access to a huge set of heterogeneous items (images, videos, different metadata schemata etc). WITH supports a variety of different data models (e.g.,  EDM, LIDO etc) and formats (e.g. XML, JSON-LD), and resolves interoperability issues by performing automatic mappings in the backend.
          </p>
          <h3>Faceted search and navigation</h3>
          <p>
            WithCulture  offers federated and faceted search services, which enable the user to explore digital CH by applying multiple search criteria in different combinations. e.g., a user may wish to search for images from certain providers with specific rights etc. The user can navigate through the results via different presentation views and retrieve more information about items of interest.  .
          </p>
          <h3>Collection management</h3>
          <p>
          Via a personal workspace, users can aggregate and organise different types of cultural resources collected from external resources or uploaded by themselves and create their own collections and exhibitions using different presentation views. Users can annotate/tag cultural items and link them with external vocabularies and thesauri. The UI supports collaborative work and interactions between users so that they can create new stories together, share their creations with other users or user groups, like and comment other usersâ€™ collections, form teams etc.
